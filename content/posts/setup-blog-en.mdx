## Choosing Our Tech Stack

The first step of building a blog is choosing the right tools. We picked:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Next.js 15 | React framework |
| Tailwind CSS | Styling system |
| Velite | MDX content management |
| GitHub Pages | Free deployment |

## Why These Tools?

### Next.js

Next.js is one of the most popular React frameworks. It supports **static export**, which means we can deploy our blog to GitHub Pages for free!

```bash
# Create the project
pnpm create next-app@latest comicbot --typescript --tailwind
```

### Velite

Velite is a lightweight content management tool that converts MDX files into type-safe data:

```typescript title="velite.config.ts"
import { defineConfig, defineCollection, s } from "velite";

const posts = defineCollection({
  name: "Post",
  pattern: "posts/**/*.mdx",
  schema: s.object({
    title: s.string(),
    date: s.isodate(),
    locale: s.enum(["zh", "en"]),
    body: s.mdx(),
  }),
});
```

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind makes writing styles super easy. Check out this button:

```html
<button class="bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-600 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-lg">
  Click me
</button>
```

> 💡 **Tip for beginners**: Don't be intimidated by all these tools! Each one is designed to make development easier. We'll cover each in detail in upcoming posts.

## What's Next

In our next posts, we'll cover how to:

1. Configure the MDX content system
2. Add code syntax highlighting
3. Implement dark mode
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

**Stay tuned!** ✨
