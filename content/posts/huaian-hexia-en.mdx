## Hexia Ancient Town: Real Life in an Ancient Place

This morning, we visited **Hexia Ancient Town** in Huai'an.

With over two thousand years of history, Hexia is one of Huai'an's most culturally rich neighborhoods. Walking in, the bluestone paths have been worn smooth by centuries of footsteps. Old houses line both sides, wisps of smoke rising from chimneys. Unlike overly commercialized tourist towns, Hexia has a genuine lived-in feel — elderly folks playing chess on the street, kids chasing each other through the alleys, the occasional rooster crowing in the distance.

That authentic, everyday atmosphere is what makes an ancient town truly moving.

## Wu Cheng'en's Former Residence: Birthplace of Journey to the West

The most famous site in the town is the **former residence of Wu Cheng'en**.

Yes — the author of *Journey to the West*! It turns out he was from Huai'an, and this was where he lived and wrote his masterpiece. The courtyard is quiet and unassuming — grey brick walls, traditional architecture, with exhibits about his life and reproductions of his manuscripts.

Our daughter was thrilled the moment she walked in: "This is where the person who wrote about the Monkey King lived!"

The courtyard features sculptures and scene recreations from the novel — the Monkey King, Pigsy, Sandy, and the monk Tripitaka, all rendered in vivid detail. Our daughter struck a "golden cudgel" pose in front of the Monkey King statue and made me take several photos.

To think that *Journey to the West* — a story we've all grown up with — was born in this quiet little courtyard. One person, one pen, one study room, creating a mythological world that has captivated people for centuries. Truly remarkable.

## Scholar Streets

Hexia Ancient Town has another surprising claim to fame — its **scholar culture**.

This unassuming little town historically produced multiple zhuangyuan (top imperial examination scorers) and jinshi (advanced scholars) — a genuine "town of academic champions." The town preserves former residences of these scholars, and even the street names carry an air of scholarly prestige — Zhuangyuan Li (Top Scholar Lane), Tanhua Xiang (Third Scholar Alley)…

Our daughter studied the scholar introductions on the street signs thoughtfully: "Dad, is a zhuangyuan like an ancient-times straight-A student?"

"Basically — the person who scored first in the entire national exam."

"Then I'm going to score first too!"

That's the spirit.

## Ancient Town Snacks

What's an ancient town visit without snacking? Hexia's food stalls are few but authentically local.

We tried **cha san** (fried dough twists) — golden, crispy, twisted into decorative shapes, as pretty as they are crunchy. Then **purcai dumplings** — made with cattail, a specialty ingredient of Huai'an, fresh and fragrant with a delicate flavor.

Our daughter's favorite was the **sweet sticky rice stuffed lotus root** — glutinous rice packed into every hole of the lotus root slices, drizzled with osmanthus honey. Pure sugary happiness in every bite.

## Ruan Dou Changyu: A Lesson at Lunch

Around noon, we found a local restaurant and ordered a Huai'an signature dish — **ruan dou changyu** (soft-poached "long fish").

Seeing "changyu" (long fish) on the menu, my first thought was: long fish? Must be loach, right? Something long and slippery — loach was the obvious guess.

The dish arrived: strips of tender, silky fish in a dark savory sauce. Looked great. I took a bite — smooth, delicate, genuinely delicious!

While eating, I casually asked the owner: "This changyu — is it loach?"

He laughed: "No, no! Changyu is **eel**! Here in Huai'an, we call eel 'changyu' — long fish."

Well, there you go! You learn something new every day. In Huai'an, freshwater eel is called "long fish," and "ruan dou" refers to the cooking technique — taking the most tender meat from along the eel's spine, then stir-frying it with soy sauce and garlic over high heat. The result is incredibly silky and tender — hence the name "soft pouch."

Our daughter was cracking up beside me: "Haha, Dad didn't even know what changyu was!"

Fair enough. This meal wasn't just filling — it was educational. But isn't that the joy of travel? Those unexpected little discoveries along the way.
