## Before Dawn, Setting Off from the Third Ring

Today is January 14, 2026. The alarm was set for 5 AM.

Outside the window, it was still pitch dark — Beijing winter mornings are freezing cold. But the thought of visiting Grandma and Grandpa had our daughter so excited the night before that she was the first one up today. After a quick scramble to get ready, the whole family bundled up tight, hopped into the car, and hit the road from the Third Ring!

The Third Ring at dawn was unusually clear — dim streetlights, hardly any cars. We got onto the Jingping Expressway and sped northeast. The GPS showed about two hours to Jizhou. Our daughter curled up under a blanket in the back seat and drifted off again, while the sky outside slowly shifted from black to deep blue.

Destination: **Wangxinfang Village, Chutouling Town, Jizhou District, Tianjin** — my hometown, where Grandma and Grandpa live.

## Breakfast at Grandma and Grandpa's

We arrived in Jizhou a little past 7 AM. The winter countryside was so quiet, and we could see wisps of smoke rising from the rooftops in the distance. Grandma and Grandpa were already waiting at the gate. When they saw our daughter hop out of the car, their faces lit up with the biggest smiles.

Grandma had breakfast all ready — steaming hot porridge, freshly steamed mantou buns, and homemade pickled vegetables. Simple home cooking, but sitting together eating it on a cold winter morning made everything feel so warm inside.

Our daughter had endless things to tell Grandpa — funny stories from school, the coding she'd been learning lately. Grandpa didn't quite understand what "code" meant, but he kept nodding with a smile: "Good, good! That's great stuff to learn!"

## Charging Up, Grabbing Snacks, and Getting Back on the Road

After breakfast and some time with the grandparents, we reluctantly said our goodbyes. Next stop: the Iron Lion of Cangzhou — still quite a drive ahead.

First, we stopped at a charging station in town to top up our EV — for long road trips in an electric car, battery level is everything. While the car was charging, our daughter tagged along with Grandma to a little shop nearby and picked out a bunch of snacks — "energy supplies for the road," she called them. Chips, cookies, yogurt — a whole bag full. Well, we're on a trip after all, might as well let her enjoy it.

## Heading South to Cangzhou

From Jizhou, we headed south. Destination — **the Iron Lion of Cangzhou**.

The Cangzhou Iron Lion is legendary — cast during the Later Zhou dynasty, over a thousand years old. I'd always wanted to take our daughter to see it, and today was finally the day.

The car hummed along the highway while our daughter munched on snacks and gazed out the window. The North China Plain in winter is vast and stark, with the occasional silhouette of a distant village.

## Plans Change

But reality has a way of humbling your plans.

After a full day of driving, our bodies started protesting. On top of that, winter days are short — by just past 5 PM, it was already getting dark. Looking at how much distance remained on the GPS, my wife and I talked it over:

> "How about we find a place to rest for the night and head out fresh in the morning?"

Our daughter was already dozing off in the back seat. That was answer enough.

## A Warm Night in Xiqing District

We ended up finding a hotel in Tianjin's Xiqing District and checked in.

A hot shower washed away most of the day's fatigue. Our daughter flopped onto the big hotel bed, rolled over once, and was fast asleep — with a little smile still on her face.

We didn't make it to Cangzhou today, but we visited Grandma and Grandpa, spent the day together as a family, laughing and chatting on the road — isn't that what travel is all about?

Iron Lion of Cangzhou, see you tomorrow!
