## Hey there! 👋

Hello! We are the authors of **Code Journey Together** — a programmer dad and his curious daughter.

The Chinese name of our blog "码上同行" (mǎ shàng tóng xíng) has a double meaning:
- **码** (mǎ) = code, representing coding together
- **马上** (mǎ shàng) = right away, representing our eagerness to start this journey

## Why This Blog?

Dad has always wanted to find a way to share the joy of programming with his daughter. And daughter? She's been curious about "those things dad types on the computer all day."

So we decided: **Learn together, write together, grow together!**

## What Will We Learn?

Our plan includes:

1. **Web Development** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
2. **React** - Building interactive UIs
3. **Python** - Data science and mini games
4. **Algorithms** - Understanding computational thinking in fun ways

## Our First Code

Let's start with the most classic program:

```javascript title="hello.js"
// Our very first program!
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to Code Journey Together 🚀`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
console.log(greet("every reader"));
```

```python title="hello.py"
# Python version
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to Code Journey Together 🚀"

print(greet("World"))
print(greet("every reader"))
```

> 💡 **Tip**: The most important thing about programming isn't syntax — it's the **problem-solving mindset**. Every programming language is just a tool; thinking is what matters!

## Final Words

This is the first step of our journey. Whether you're a coding beginner or a veteran, you're welcome to join us!

**Let's code together!** 🎉
