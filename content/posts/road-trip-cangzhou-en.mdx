## From Xiqing to Cangzhou

We slept in and woke up naturally. Pulling open the curtains, the winter sunlight of Tianjin streamed in, instantly lifting our spirits.

After a quick breakfast, we checked out and hit the road again. Today's mission was crystal clear — **Cangzhou**, the destination we didn't quite reach yesterday. Today, we were finishing the job!

From Xiqing District, we got on the expressway heading south — about two and a half hours of driving. Our daughter sat in the back, rummaging through yesterday's snack stash, munching on cookies while watching the fields flash by outside.

## Cangzhou Museum: A Hundred Lions

When we arrived in Cangzhou, we didn't go straight to the Iron Lion. Instead, we headed to the **Cangzhou Museum** first. Turns out, that was a brilliant call.

The moment we walked in, the most stunning exhibit was the **"Hundred Lions"** gallery. Stone lions from every dynasty — from the earliest Shang dynasty all the way to the Qing — lined up in a grand procession. Watching them evolve from rough and primitive to intricately carved felt like flipping through a 3D history book.

Our daughter kept asking questions: "Dad, why did ancient Chinese people love lions so much? There aren't even lions in China!"

Great question! Lions were actually introduced to China along the Silk Road. Over time, they transformed from "exotic beasts" into "guardian protectors," earning a unique place in Chinese culture — symbolizing power, good fortune, and protection. Each dynasty's lions had a distinct style reflecting the aesthetics and culture of that era. From the clean, simple lines of the Shang dynasty to the elaborate ornamental carvings of the Qing, you could feel thousands of years of cultural depth.

## Second Floor: A Thousand Years of the Grand Canal

After the lion exhibit, we headed upstairs to the second floor.

This section traced Cangzhou's cultural evolution from the Shang dynasty all the way to modern times. The most impressive part was about the **Grand Canal** — Cangzhou sits along a crucial stretch of this ancient waterway. For centuries, the canal brought thriving trade and rich cultural exchange to the city.

The exhibition featured old photographs of the canal banks, models of ancient grain transport barges, and everyday items from different periods. Our daughter stared at an ancient bronze coin for the longest time — probably calculating how many snacks it could buy.

From the prosperous days of canal trade to modern industrial development and today's thriving city, Cangzhou's economic story was laid out beautifully. A single museum, a portrait of an entire city.

## The Iron Lion: High Hopes, Closed Gates

By the time we finished the museum, it was already afternoon. We hurried to the car and drove to the ultimate goal of our trip — **the Iron Lion of Cangzhou**.

The Cangzhou Iron Lion was cast in 953 AD during the Later Zhou dynasty — over a thousand years old, and the largest surviving cast-iron artifact in China. The whole drive there, our daughter kept asking: "How big is the Iron Lion really? Is it actually made of iron?"

But when we pulled up to the entrance, we were greeted by a closed gate — **they had already shut down for the day**.

Disappointment was written all over our daughter's face. Honestly, I felt it too. We'd come all this way, only to miss it by a hair.

## Unexpected Joy at Nanchuan Old Street Park

But that's the beauty of travel — outside your plans, there are always unexpected surprises.

Since the Iron Lion was a no-go, we drove over to **Nanchuan Old Street Park** instead. Built along the canal, the park had a charming old-town feel — quaint alleys and riverside scenery. With few visitors in winter, it was peaceful and almost poetic.

Our daughter ran around chasing fallen leaves, her earlier disappointment completely forgotten. She said: "It's okay that we didn't see the Iron Lion. We can come back next time! Now we have an excuse to visit Cangzhou again."

Honestly, that's wiser than most adults would be about it.

## The Drive Home

As the sky darkened, we began the drive back.

Soft music played in the car. Our daughter leaned against the back seat and slowly closed her eyes. Two days on the road — from Beijing to Jizhou to see Grandma and Grandpa, then to Cangzhou to explore the museum. We didn't get to see the Iron Lion, but the laughter and togetherness along the way — that was the real treasure of this trip.

Next time, we'll get there early. Iron Lion, wait for us!
