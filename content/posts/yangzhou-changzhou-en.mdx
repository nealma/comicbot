## Free Parking at Government Buildings — Heartwarming

The first surprise in Yangzhou came from an unexpected place: parking.

During the Spring Festival holiday, Yangzhou's **government buildings opened their parking lots to tourists for free**. Yes, you read that right — government compounds threw open their gates so visitors could park at no charge. It was genuinely touching — a city's attitude toward tourists often shows in these small details.

We parked comfortably, hearts warmed. Yangzhou: first impression, full marks.

## Slender West Lake: A Painted Paradise

Yangzhou's most famous attraction is undoubtedly **Slender West Lake**.

The moment we entered, we were struck by its grandeur — the lake stretches long and narrow like a ribbon, willows draping along both banks, pavilions and towers dotting the landscape. It was winter, but during the Spring Festival holiday, the park was packed with visitors, buzzing with laughter and celebration.

Walking along the lake, we arrived at the much-anticipated **Twenty-Four Bridge**. "On the Twenty-Four Bridge under a moonlit night, where does the jade beauty teach the flute?" — the Tang dynasty poet Du Mu's poem made this bridge famous across China. No moonlight to see during the day, but the elegant arch and the sweeping lake view from the top were still breathtaking.

Our daughter leaned over the railing counting steps: "Dad, does this bridge really have twenty-four steps?" She was right — the bridge is 24 meters long, 2.4 meters wide, with 24 steps on each end. Everything about it echoes the number twenty-four.

Further along stood the iconic **Five Pavilion Bridge** — five pavilions perched side by side on a bridge, their upturned eaves reflected in the shimmering water. It's the most recognizable image of Slender West Lake. Our daughter said it "looks like a crown sitting on the water" — a pretty apt description.

## Ge Garden: Four Seasons in a Salt Merchant's Mansion

After Slender West Lake, we headed to **Ge Garden** — another must-see in Yangzhou.

The garden's name comes from the Chinese character for bamboo (竹), split in half to form 个. True to its name, the garden is famous for its **bamboo**. Several rare varieties grow here — some standing tall and straight, others curving gracefully, and some with uniquely shaped joints. Besides bamboo, orange trees dotted the garden, their golden fruit adding splashes of color to the winter landscape.

The most brilliant feature of Ge Garden is its **Four Seasons Rockery** — different types of stone arranged to evoke spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Spring uses bamboo shoot stones, full of vitality. Summer features Taihu stones, intricate and delicate. Autumn employs yellow stones, bold and majestic. Winter uses snow-white stones, cold and stark. Walking through the garden feels like traveling through all four seasons — the design ingenuity is remarkable.

The garden was reportedly the private residence of **Huang Zhiyun**, a wealthy Qing dynasty salt merchant. Yangzhou was historically a hub for salt merchants who rivaled the wealth of nations, and their estates were built accordingly. We walked through hall after hall — the formal reception room, the **ladies' boudoir**, the guest entertainment parlors, and the private living quarters. Every room featured carved beams and painted rafters, with exquisite furniture and decor that spoke to the extraordinary wealth and taste of those merchant families.

Our daughter was most fascinated by the boudoir, pressing her face against the window for the longest time: "The ladies in ancient times lived in such beautiful rooms!"

The architecture and layout of the entire garden are truly world-class — no wonder it's listed among China's Four Great Gardens.

## Yangzhou Cuisine: One Family, Two Opinions

After all that sightseeing, it was finally time for the famous Yangzhou cuisine!

Huaiyang cuisine is one of China's Four Great Culinary Traditions. We found a well-established restaurant and ordered a table full of classics:

- **Guantang bao** (soup dumplings) — paper-thin skin, rich broth that bursts with flavor at first bite
- **Sanding bao** (three-diced buns) — chicken, pork, and bamboo shoot filling, savory without being heavy
- **Yangzhou fried rice** — how can you visit Yangzhou without trying the fried rice? Each grain separate, loaded with ingredients
- **Feicui shaomai** (jade shumai) — translucent green wrappers with a delicately sweet filling, as beautiful as they are tasty

My wife and daughter ate with beaming smiles, praising everything as "so delicious!"

But honestly... I personally thought it was just okay? Not bad by any means, but it didn't quite reach the "wow" factor I'd been expecting. Maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe my northern palate just isn't tuned to appreciate Huaiyang cuisine's refined subtlety.

But seeing my wife and daughter enjoying every bite — then it must be truly delicious! (A survival-instinct answer if there ever was one.)

## Night Drive to Changzhou

In the afternoon, we left Yangzhou and drove to **Changzhou**.

After checking into the hotel, we went out for dinner and found a **Henan restaurant** nearby. Eating Henan food in the heart of Jiangnan felt a bit funny, but the flavors were surprisingly authentic — hearty and satisfying.

Full and content, we headed back to the hotel. Another day packed with memories. Tomorrow, the journey south continues!
