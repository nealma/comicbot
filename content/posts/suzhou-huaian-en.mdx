## Yi Pu: A Quiet Garden Gem

Today's itinerary was relaxed — just one destination: Suzhou's **Yi Pu** (Art Garden).

Compared to the famous Humble Administrator's Garden or Lingering Garden, Yi Pu is far more low-key. But those in the know consider it one of the most authentic Suzhou gardens of all.

Tucked deep in a maze of old alleyways, its entrance is easy to miss. But step inside and you enter another world. The garden is small, yet every angle reveals a carefully composed scene — Taihu stones arranged into delicate rockeries, a crystal-clear pond, pavilions and trees reflected perfectly in the still water.

What makes Yi Pu truly special is its tranquility. No crushing crowds like at the bigger gardens, no commercial noise — just a handful of visitors strolling quietly, occasionally sitting by the water to simply be. This is what a Suzhou garden should feel like — unhurried, savored slowly.

Our daughter wove in and out of the rockery, discovering several "secret passages" and treating the whole thing like a treasure hunt. "This garden is small," she said, "but it's so fun — like a mini maze!"

Small but exquisite — that's Yi Pu in a nutshell.

## Suzhou Snacks

Coming out of Yi Pu, we found food on the old streets nearby.

Suzhou snacks are as refined as its gardens. We had **Suzhou-style noodle soup** — clear broth, delicate flavor, silky thin noodles. Then **sweet rice porridge** — warm, glutinous, and comforting. Our daughter picked out a piece of **osmanthus cake**, and one bite filled her mouth with the fragrance of sweet osmanthus flowers.

Eating in Suzhou isn't about big portions — it's about elegance.

## Driving North to Huai'an

In the afternoon, we said goodbye to Suzhou and drove north toward **Huai'an**.

Over the next few hours, the landscape gradually shifted from Jiangnan water towns to the open plains of northern Jiangsu. The scenery outside the window changed from quaint bridges and flowing streams to broad, flat farmland. Our daughter watched quietly from the back seat, probably replaying these past few days of Jiangnan adventures in her mind.

We arrived in Huai'an by evening, checked into our hotel, and settled in for the night. A simple day, but just right.

Sometimes a trip doesn't need a packed schedule. A little breathing room makes it even better.
