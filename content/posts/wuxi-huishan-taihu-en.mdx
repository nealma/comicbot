## Huishan Ancient Town: Wall-to-Wall People

First stop today — **Huishan Ancient Town**.

Before we even reached the entrance, we could feel the Spring Festival "enthusiasm" — a sea of people, shoulder to shoulder, heads as far as the eye could see. But then again, the more crowded a place is, the more it says about being worth the visit.

Huishan Ancient Town is nestled at the foot of Xi Mountain and Hui Mountain, and it's the most quintessentially Jiangnan spot in Wuxi. Winding bluestone paths, white-walled buildings with dark grey tiles, red lanterns hanging from doorways, and intricately carved wooden lattice windows. Walking through felt like stepping back centuries into a classic southern water town.

The town is packed with ancestral halls — reportedly one of the densest concentrations in all of China. Each hall tells the story of a prominent Wuxi clan, with brick carvings, stone engravings, and poetic couplets everywhere. The cultural depth is incredible.

Our daughter wasn't too interested in the ancestral halls, but the street food vendors were another story — sugar paintings, candied hawthorns, osmanthus cake, fermented rice dumplings… she wanted to stop every few steps for a taste. Well, isn't that the whole point of exploring an ancient town — eating your way through it?

Our favorite part was the small bridges over flowing water. A clear stream runs through the center of town, crossed by little stone arch bridges packed with photo-snapping tourists. Despite the crowds, looking down from a bridge at the white walls, dark tiles, and red lanterns reflected in the water — in that moment, we truly felt what it means when they say **Jiangnan is a living painting**.

## Cycling to Lake Tai

After the ancient town, we switched gears — literally — and **cycled to Lake Tai**!

We rented bikes and rode along the lakeside greenway. In winter, Lake Tai stretches vast and shimmering, with distant hills fading in and out of the haze. The air was crisp and fresh, begging for deep breaths. Compared to the packed ancient town, the lakeside was wonderfully peaceful — cycling with the breeze, pure bliss.

Our daughter rode ahead, sprinting forward then slowing down to wait, yelling back "Hurry up, keep up!" — where does she get all that energy?

## Playground Paradise by the Lake

When we reached a recreational area by the lake, our daughter's eyes lit up — outdoor play equipment everywhere!

First, she dashed to the **swings**, pumping higher and higher, her laughter carrying across the water. Then she scrambled over to the **climbing frame**, hands and feet working in coordination, scrambling to the top in no time and waving triumphantly down at us. Next, she dragged me to the **seesaw** — up and down, my side heavy and hers flying up, both of us laughing uncontrollably.

While she played to her heart's content, my wife and I found a bench nearby, sat down in the sunshine, watched the lake, and chatted. This is probably what vacation is supposed to look like — no schedule, no itinerary, just sitting there watching your kid run around with pure joy.

She played until she was drenched in sweat, then came running over breathlessly: "Dad, Lake Tai is so much fun! I want to come back next time!"

That's probably the highest review Lake Tai has ever received.
