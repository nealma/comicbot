## Badaju, Here We Come

**Zibo's Badaju Walking Street** — the place that went viral across all of China for its barbecue — and today we finally visited in person.

Before we even stepped inside, the air was thick with the aroma of grilled meat. The street isn't particularly long, but food stalls line both sides, packed tight. The sounds of vendors calling out, meat sizzling on grills, and diners laughing all blend together into a symphony of pure festive energy — well, it is still the Spring Festival after all.

Our daughter couldn't take two steps without stopping, her eyes wider than her stomach, wanting to try absolutely everything.

## Purple Rice Cake and Stir-Fried Griddle Bread

First up: a piece of **purple rice cake** — soft, sticky, and subtly sweet, with just the right amount of grain texture. One bite and it's all toasty rice fragrance. Our daughter finished one piece and immediately demanded another, mumbling through a full mouth: "This is so good."

Next: **stir-fried griddle bread** — golden flatbread cut into strips and wok-tossed with vegetables over roaring heat. Crispy outside, soft inside, savory and smoky with that unmistakable wok hei. This kind of street food demands to be eaten standing right next to the stall, piping hot.

## Juyouzhai Spare Ribs

We stumbled upon a shop called **Juyouzhai**, famous for their spare ribs.

After a short wait in line, a plate arrived — small ribs braised until impossibly tender, glazed in a deep savory sauce. One gentle bite and the meat slid right off the bone, the salty-sweet sauce and rich pork flavor bursting in your mouth.

Absolutely top-tier.

My wife and daughter each grabbed several pieces, and I wasn't shy either. One plate demolished, the family verdict was unanimous: "This place is a must-recommend!"

## Zibo BBQ: Joy on Tiny Stools

Now for the main event — **Zibo barbecue**!

We found an authentic BBQ stall and sat down. The signature setup appeared immediately: **tiny stools, tiny tables, tiny flatbreads**. No fancy decor, no Instagram-worthy plating — just honest, no-frills roadside barbecue. But that smoky, bustling, down-to-earth atmosphere is exactly what makes Zibo BBQ legendary.

Skewers arrived sizzling with oil, dusted with cumin and chili flakes. You grab a small flatbread, lay down a skewer, add a sprig of green onion, roll it up — and take a bite. Meat, bread, and onion fuse into one glorious mouthful. Pure satisfaction.

Our daughter tried to roll her own flatbread, copying our technique. Her first attempt was lopsided with half the filling falling out, but that didn't stop her from eating with oil running down her chin and a grin that wouldn't quit.

Sitting on a tiny stool, steaming skewers in front of us, family laughing beside us, winter sun overhead — this is what they mean when they say "the warmth of everyday life soothes the soul."

## The One Regret

Eating barbecue without beer just feels incomplete.

Watching the guys at the next table clinking glasses, eating big and drinking bigger, I quietly raised my… Coca-Cola. **Don't drink and drive, don't drive and drink.**

Our daughter gloated from beside me: "Dad can only have Coke! Hahaha!"

My wife, at least, was sympathetic: "Next time we'll take the high-speed train so you can drink all you want."

Deal. I'm holding you to that.
