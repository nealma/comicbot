## Spring City, Here We Come

Jinan, known as the "Spring City," is famous for its countless natural springs scattered throughout the city. We'd heard about it for years, and today we finally got to see it with our own eyes.

First thing in the morning, we headed straight for **Baotu Spring**. Known as the "Number One Spring Under Heaven," it truly lived up to its name — three jets of water surge up from underground, the surface constantly churning. Even in the dead of winter, the spring water is warm, with a thin mist hovering over the surface, giving it an almost magical quality.

Our daughter leaned over the railing and stared for the longest time: "Dad, why does the water come up by itself?"

"It's groundwater pushed up by underground pressure through cracks in the rock."

"Oh… so it's like when I shake a Coke bottle and open the cap and it sprays out?"

Well… not the worst analogy, honestly.

## Spring City Square and Black Tiger Spring

After Baotu Spring, we walked over to **Spring City Square**. The square is grand and open, with a striking blue spring sculpture in the center — Jinan's iconic city landmark. Winter sunlight spread across the plaza, and despite the cold, it felt lovely just strolling around.

Following the moat, we soon arrived at **Black Tiger Spring**. Three stone tiger heads with gaping mouths spout water with an impressive roar. Locals were gathered around with buckets, filling up with fresh spring water — apparently it's clean enough to drink straight.

Our daughter watched the water gushing from the tigers' mouths and burst out laughing: "The tigers are spitting water!"

## Daming Lake and White Stone Spring

Next up: **Daming Lake**. There's a famous poem about it — "Lotus on four sides, willows on three, mountain views across half the city." No lotus in winter, but the vast lake with Qianfo Mountain faintly visible in the distance had its own quiet beauty.

While walking along the lakeside, we stumbled upon **White Stone Spring**. Unlike the grandeur of Baotu Spring or the fierceness of Black Tiger Spring, White Stone Spring is small and delicate — water bubbling gently through white stone crevices, crystal clear. Our daughter crouched down to watch and declared that this spring "looks very gentle."

Big springs, small springs, each with its own personality — that's the charm of Jinan.

## Bazi Rou: The Taste of Jinan

After a whole morning of walking, our stomachs were growling. And you can't visit Jinan without trying **bazi rou** — Jinan-style braised pork belly.

We found a popular local spot called **Wuyue Bazi Rou**. Thick slabs of pork belly, slow-braised in soy sauce until glossy and tender — rich but not greasy, melting in your mouth. Paired with steamed rice and a bowl of hot broth, it was winter comfort food perfection.

Our daughter, who normally avoids fatty meat, voluntarily grabbed several pieces, nodding as she chewed: "This meat is so good! It's not oily at all!"

Apparently, pickiness doesn't stand a chance against truly great food.

## Driving to Tai'erzhuang

Full and rested, we got back on the road for the highlight of the day — **Tai'erzhuang Ancient City**.

It's about a three-hour drive from Jinan. Along the way, our daughter asked a lot of questions about Tai'erzhuang. I told her about the famous **Battle of Tai'erzhuang in 1938** — the first major Chinese victory in the War of Resistance against Japan. Because of that battle, Tai'erzhuang earned the title "the place where the Chinese nation demonstrated its unyielding spirit."

"So the ancient city was a battlefield?"

"Yes. The war nearly destroyed the entire city. What we see now was rebuilt, but they preserved many traces of its history."

## The Dazzling Night of Tai'erzhuang

We arrived at Tai'erzhuang just as evening fell. The lights came on, and the ancient city transformed into a dazzling dreamscape.

Walking through the gates, the pedestrian streets were flanked by traditional architecture — upturned eaves, hanging lanterns, all bathed in warm golden light. The Grand Canal flows right through the city, its surface reflecting the lights on both banks in a shimmering dance. It was breathtakingly beautiful.

Our daughter grabbed my hand, eyes wide: "Dad, this is SO beautiful!"

She was right. It was truly stunning.

## Molten Iron Fireworks and the Fire Dragon

As we strolled through, we heard a roar of cheers in the distance. We followed the sound and found a packed square — a **Da Tie Hua** performance was underway!

Da Tie Hua, or "striking iron flowers," is an ancient Chinese art form. Performers hurl molten iron heated to 1,600 degrees into the air, striking it to send thousands of sparks cascading across the night sky — like golden firework trees blooming overhead. Each strike drew gasps and cheers from the crowd.

Even more spectacular: above it all, a **fire dragon** danced through the shower of sparks! The iron flowers and the dragon together, golden light raining down from above — it was absolutely mesmerizing. Our daughter stood there open-mouthed, repeating "wow, wow, wow" on a loop.

This is a Chinese intangible cultural heritage tradition spanning over a thousand years. Seeing it on New Year's Eve felt especially fitting — those sparks were like the most brilliant blessing for the new year.

## New Year's Eve, Spring Festival Gala Time

We reluctantly left the ancient city and got back to the hotel.

After washing up, the whole family piled onto the bed and turned on the TV — the **Spring Festival Gala** had started!

We weren't celebrating New Year at home this time, but with the whole family together, great food, incredible sights, and the Gala on TV, this New Year's Eve was just as warm and complete.

Our daughter leaned against my shoulder, watching the performances on screen, and suddenly said: "Dad, this is the best Spring Festival ever."

Hearing that made every mile of the journey worth it.

Happy New Year! 🧨
