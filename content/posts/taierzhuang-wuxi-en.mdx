## New Year's Day, Back to the Ancient City

Last night's view of Tai'erzhuang was so stunning that the family agreed without hesitation: let's explore it again in daylight! The night is all about shimmering lights, but daytime reveals the historical character — each beautiful in its own way.

On the morning of the first day of Chinese New Year, the ancient city was brimming with festive spirit. Red lanterns hung from every alley, spring couplets and paper-cut decorations adorned the walls, and visitors in their new clothes carried the unmistakable joy of a fresh new year.

## Liuqin Opera: The Sound of Southern Shandong

As we walked, a melodious tune drifted through the air — it was **Liuqin opera**!

Tai'erzhuang sits in southern Shandong, where Liuqin opera is the most iconic local art form. Performers in traditional costumes played the liuqin (a Chinese lute-like instrument), their singing voices shifting between soaring passion and gentle tenderness. We couldn't catch every word, but the melody and emotion made us stop in our tracks.

Our daughter stood in the crowd, completely mesmerized. When it ended, she clapped enthusiastically. "I didn't understand the words," she said, "but it was SO cool!"

That's the magic of traditional opera — it transcends language and time, touching your heart all the same.

## Tianhou Temple: An Interactive Performance

Next, we visited the **Tianhou Temple** (Temple of the Heavenly Queen). Tai'erzhuang thrived because of the Grand Canal — merchant ships came and went endlessly, and the Tianhou Temple was where boatmen and traders prayed for safe passage.

Today, there was an interactive performance where actors played ancient merchants, boat ladies, and pilgrims — and the audience was invited to join in. Our daughter got picked to play a young pilgrim, earnestly bowing along with the performance, which had the crowd in stitches.

Canal culture came alive here — no longer just words in a textbook, but something you could touch, join, and experience firsthand.

## The Twelve Flower Fairies

The highlight for our daughter was the **Twelve Flower Fairies interactive performance**.

Twelve performers in magnificent traditional costumes glided through the ancient city, each representing a different flower. Their outfits and makeup were exquisitely designed — they looked like figures stepping straight out of a classical painting. They danced and posed among the pavilions and terraces, taking photos with visitors along the way.

Our daughter's favorite was the plum blossom fairy — fitting, since winter is plum blossom season. She posed for a photo with the fairy, beaming brighter than the flowers themselves.

## Revival Tower: A Bird's Eye View

Finally, we climbed the **Revival Tower** (Fuxing Lou).

The tower is the highest point in Tai'erzhuang Ancient City. From the top, the entire city spread out below — grey-tiled roofs and white walls arranged in elegant patterns, the canal winding through like a jade ribbon, the city walls and old docks visible in the distance.

Standing up there, remembering that this city survived the flames of war and was rebuilt from ruins, the name "Revival" carries a profound weight.

Our daughter leaned on the railing, taking it all in, and remarked: "From up here, the ancient city looks like a giant maze!"

## Heading South to Wuxi

In the afternoon, we reluctantly said goodbye to Tai'erzhuang and began the journey south.

Next stop — **Wuxi**. It's about a five-hour drive from Tai'erzhuang, crossing the northern Jiangsu plains and the Yangtze River into the water towns of Jiangnan.

Our daughter sat in the back, scrolling through her photos with the Flower Fairies, smiling the whole time. Gradually, she leaned against the window and drifted off to sleep.

By the time night fell, we had arrived safely in Wuxi and checked into our hotel. After a hot shower, the first day of the new year came to a close — full, satisfying, and happy.

Tomorrow, the Jiangnan adventure officially begins!
